FOSDEM is one of the main conferences for open source developers in Europe. In 2015, FOSDEM will take place the 31st of january and 1st of February in Brussels, Belgium. This iPhone application allows you to view the schedule of the many technical and social events in a convenient way. You can mark events you want to see in advance and view them later. While the conference is going on, you can view the current and upcoming events. And in case you get lost on the campus, a map for each event shows you where to go.After the conference is finished you can see the available videos of the conference up to 2007. The schedules of the previous conferences (up to 2007) are also available.Developers: Johan Henselmans Adam Ziolkowski, Leon HandrekeGet the code! https://github.com/johanhenselmans/fosdem/
