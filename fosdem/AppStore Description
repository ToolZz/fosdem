FOSDEM is one of the main conferences for open source developers in Europe. In 2010, FOSDEM will take place the 6th and 7th of February in Brussels, Belgium. This iPhone application allows you to view the schedule of the many technical and social events in a convenient way. You can mark events you want to see in advance and view them later. While the conference is going on, you can view the current and upcoming events. And in case you get lost on the campus, a map for each event shows you where to go.Developers: Adam Ziolkowski, Leon HandrekeGet the code! http://github.com/leonbrussels/fosdem
